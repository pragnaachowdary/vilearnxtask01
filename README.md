LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT USING GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This repository contains the source code and instructions for deploying a Library Management System (LMS) on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The LMS includes a front-end interface for user interaction and a back-end server for managing library operations, such as book borrowing, returning, and user management

**OBJECTIVES**

**FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT**
Develop a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (like React, Angular, or Vue.js) to facilitate interaction with the library system.

**BACK-END DEVELOPMENT**
Implement a server-side application using a back-end framework (such as Node.js, Python with Django/Flask, or PHP) to handle business logic and interact with a database for storing library data.

**GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM SETUP**
Utilize GCP services, including Google Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and possibly App Engine, to deploy both front-end and back-end components of the Library Management System.

**DEPLOYMENT AND ACCESSIBILITY**
Ensure the LMS is fully deployed on GCP and is publicly accessible, allowing users to interact with the system over the internet.

**PROJECT STRUCTURE**
**FRONT-END/**
**Directory containing all front-end code:**
index.html – Main HTML page for the user interface.
styles/ – Directory for CSS files.
scripts/ – Directory for JavaScript files and front-end logic.
assets/ – Directory containing images, icons, and other static assets.

**BACK-END/**
**Directory containing back-end code:**
app/ – Main application directory with server-side scripts.
routes/ – Directory for defining API endpoints.
models/ – Directory containing database models (e.g., books, users).
controllers/ – Directory for handling business logic and data processing.
config/ – Configuration files for database connections and server settings.

**DATABASE/**
Contains SQL scripts or configurations for initializing and setting up the database schema.

**README.md**
Documentation for understanding and deploying the Library Management System.

**LICENSE**
License information for the project.

**DEPLOYMENT GUIDE**
To deploy the Library Management System on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), follow these steps:

**1. SET UP GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM SERVICES**
Create a Project
Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project for your LMS deployment.

Enable Required APIs
Enable necessary APIs such as Google Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and App Engine depending on your architecture and deployment strategy.

**2. FRONT-END DEPLOYMENT**
Set Up Google Cloud Storage for Static Files

Create a new bucket in Google Cloud Storage to host the front-end files.
Upload all front-end files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the bucket.
Make the bucket publicly accessible by setting the appropriate permissions:
Go to Permissions and add the "allUsers" entity with the "Storage Object Viewer" role.
Access the Front-End

The front-end interface can be accessed via the public URL generated by Google Cloud Storage:
http://storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME]/index.html

**3. BACK-END DEPLOYMENT**
Deploy the Back-End Application
Use either Google Compute Engine or Google App Engine:

**Compute Engine:**
Create a new VM instance on Compute Engine.
Set up the server environment (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) by installing necessary dependencies.
Deploy the back-end code to the VM instance via SSH or FTP.

**App Engine:**
Deploy directly using the gcloud command line tool:
bash
Copy code
gcloud app deploy
Database Configuration
Set up a Cloud SQL instance or another database service.
Import the provided SQL scripts or set up the schema manually in the DATABASE/ directory.
Configure the back-end to connect to the Cloud SQL instance by updating the connection settings in the config files.

**4. FINAL SETUP AND CONFIGURATION**
Environment Variables
Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, API keys) using GCP's secret management tools.

**Testing and Validation**
Test the Library Management System to ensure all features work correctly (e.g., user registration, book borrowing/returning).
Verify that both front-end and back-end components are properly deployed and operational.
GETTING STARTED
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local development environment:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
Install Dependencies
Install all necessary dependencies for both front-end and back-end components:
bash
Copy code
cd front-end
npm install
cd ../back-end
npm install
Run Locally
To run the front-end locally, open index.html in your browser.
To run the back-end server locally:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Deploy to GCP
Follow the steps in the DEPLOYMENT GUIDE to deploy the application on Google Cloud Platform.

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**
Version Control
Use meaningful commit messages and maintain version control to track the development process and changes.
**Security Best Practices**
Ensure all sensitive data is secure and follow best practices for access control and security settings in GCP.
