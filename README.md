# DEPLOYING A WEB APPLICATION ON AWS

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project involves deploying a simple web application on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The objective is to gain practical experience in cloud computing by setting up a server, configuring it, and deploying a web application that is accessible online. This project will cover the basics of AWS, including account setup, server configuration, application deployment, and network configuration.

## OBJECTIVES

1. **Develop a Simple Web Application**:  
   Create a basic web application using a preferred programming language and framework (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP).

2. **AWS Account Setup**:  
   Set up an AWS account and familiarize yourself with the AWS Management Console to manage AWS services.

3. **Server Configuration**:  
   Set up and configure an **EC2 instance** or another suitable AWS service (like **Elastic Beanstalk** or **Lightsail**) to host the web application.

4. **Deploy the Application**:  
   Upload and deploy the web application to the configured AWS server.

5. **Access the Application**:  
   Ensure the web application is accessible via a public URL.

## REQUIREMENTS

- **Web Development Skills**: Basic knowledge of developing web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other programming languages.
- **AWS Skills**: Familiarity with the AWS environment, including setting up an account and using the AWS Management Console.
- **Server Configuration**: Understanding how to configure web servers (Nginx or Apache) and manage AWS services.
- **Networking**: Basic knowledge of network security, including setting up security groups and firewall rules.

## TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

- **AWS Services**: EC2, S3, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, or Lightsail.
- **Web Development Tools**: Any code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
- **Command Line Tools**: AWS CLI, SSH.
- **Web Servers**: Nginx or Apache.
- **Database Management**: Optional (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

## DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

### 1. **AWS ACCOUNT SETUP**

- **Create an AWS Account**:  
  Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and create a new account.
- **Set Up IAM User**:  
  Create an **IAM user** with appropriate permissions to manage AWS services.
- **Configure AWS CLI**:  
  Install the AWS CLI tool and configure it with your credentials:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```

### 2. **DEVELOP A SIMPLE WEB APPLICATION**

- **Create Your Application**:  
  Develop a basic web application in your preferred language and framework. This can be as simple as a "Hello, World!" app or a more complex CRUD application.
- **Test Locally**:  
  Ensure the application runs correctly on your local machine before deploying to AWS.

### 3. **SERVER CONFIGURATION**

- **Launch an EC2 Instance**:  
  - Open the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Management Console.
  - Click **Launch Instance** and select an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI), such as Amazon Linux or Ubuntu.
  - Choose an instance type (e.g., **t2.micro** for free tier eligibility).
  - Configure instance details, including network settings and security groups (allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic).
  - Launch the instance and download the key pair (PEM file) for SSH access.

- **Connect to the EC2 Instance**:  
  Use SSH to connect to your instance:
  ```bash
  ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
  ```

- **Install Required Software**:  
  Install necessary web server software (Nginx or Apache) and other dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  sudo yum install -y nginx
  ```

### 4. **DEPLOY THE APPLICATION**

- **Upload Application Files**:  
  Use SCP or SFTP to upload your web application files to the EC2 instance:
  ```bash
  scp -i /path/to/key.pem -r /local/path/to/app ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns:/var/www/html
  ```

- **Configure the Web Server**:  
  Update the web server configuration to serve your application. For Nginx, you might edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or add a new site configuration in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.

- **Start the Web Server**:  
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  ```

### 5. **ACCESS THE APPLICATION**

- **Public URL**:  
  The web application should now be accessible via the public DNS or IP address of the EC2 instance.
  - Example: `http://your-instance-public-dns`

- **Verify Deployment**:  
  Open a web browser and enter the public URL to verify that the application is running correctly.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

- **Security**: Ensure your instance's security group allows inbound traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
- **Persistence**: For a more robust setup, consider using Amazon RDS for the database and S3 for storing static files.
- **Scaling**: For production environments, use **Elastic Load Balancing** and **Auto Scaling** for high availability and scalability.
